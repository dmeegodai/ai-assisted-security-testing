## 🤖 AI Contributions

Throughout this project, AI tools are used for:
- 🧠 Generating secure test case logic from API contracts
- 🧪 Simulating security attacks via prompt-based fuzzing
- 🔍 Analysing scan reports (ZAP, Burp) with summaries
- 🛡️ Threat modelling suggestions
- 💡 Fixing and rewriting insecure code

AI-related files, prompts, and outputs are stored in the `AI_Contributions/` folder and cross-linked from section folders.
